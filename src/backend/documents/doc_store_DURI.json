But often, these services are delivered based on a user\u2019s sensitive personal information, including demographic identity and various biometric data, ranging from heart rate to breathing patterns. Therefore, researchers have been using this biometric data to validate a user. However, in the age of Generative AI, it is possible to produce synthetic data. Hence, it is important to understand how biometric samples can be fatal in predicting a user\u2019s identity and his/her entire cyber-physical space, which has been secured with those biometrics in order to foster global security.\nSupervisor:\nSudip Vhaduri\nMentor:\nSudip Vhaduri\nType of work required:\nWorking with an interdisciplinary research team, in this project, students will first process various types of data, e.g., heart rate, gait, and breathing patterns, among several others obtained from smartphones and smart wearables. Then, students will visualize and compute different features. Finally, students will develop machine learning and AI models to generate synthetic data that can be used to breach an authentication model developed with the user\u2019s original data. During this project, student researchers will be closely guided in every step, including problem formulation, data processing and characterizations, statistical analysis, and data visualization, model development, and interpretation of findings. Participating in this project, our student researchers will achieve technical expertise to solve real-world problems. The students will also get a clear idea of",

Playing and listening to music is one of the most universal forms of communication and entertainment across cultures. Unfortunately, many people are hearing-impaired, unable to fully enjoy music. By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to have some degree of hearing loss, and at least 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation (source: World Health Organization). This project aims to create technologies that visualize music, assisting the hearing-impaired in understanding and enjoying music. The technical process comprises the following steps: (a) Music is analyzed and classified into multiple dimensions, including instrumentation, emotion, tempo, pitch range, harmony, dynamics, and more. This analysis yields textual descriptions. (b) The texts form features and are inputs to machine learning models for classification. (c) These models predict the genre of the input audio and its associated emotions. These predictions form the basis for text prompts that describe the music. (d) The prompts are fed into generative machine models (e.g., DALL-E-2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney) to create visual representations, such as images or",

Variations in the prompts produce different styles of images. These images and videos are generated without human intervention, significantly reducing costs and time to produce visual representations tailored to the specific piece of music. This approach is different from video recordings of music performance because recordings can provide only passive watching experience. In contrast, the proposed solution has the advantage of creating personalized and interactive entertainment experience for the hearing-impaired. This proposed project will conduct extensive user studies to evaluate whether generative models can effectively produce visual representations of music's rich expression, heralding a novel form of entertainment for the hearing-impaired.\nSupervisor:\nYung-hsiang Lu\nMentor:\nYung-hsiang Lu\nType of work required:\nThe students will (1) conduct literature survey to understand the state of the art using generative artificial intelligence for entertainment, (2) develop software that implements the steps mentioned in the description, (3) evaluate the efficacy of proposed solution (in the form of user studies), (4) design a website to promote generative arts used in entertainment.\nWebsites:\nhttps://ai4musicians.org/\nQualifications:\nhas taken at least one programming course\nCredit Hours:\n2\nWeekly Hours:\n10 (estimated) \n\n\n\nProject:\nAI-Driven Walkability Ecosystem: Enhancing Public Health through Personalized, Social, and Adaptive Mobility Solutions\nProgram:\nDUIRI - Discovery Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Internship\nTerm:\nSpring 2025\nStatus:\nAccepted\nResearch Area:\nArtificial Intelligence; Large Language Models; Human Computer Interaction; Decision Support\nDescription:\nThis project proposes the development of an AI-Driven Walkability Ecosystem, a personalized, real-time mobile application designed to enhance walkability and public health by integrating adaptive technology with social and behavioral insights.

Our numerical simulations showed an increase of up to 12x -123x for different configurations of fiber filters. Currently, we are constructing a bench-scale experimental setup to demonstrate the complex interaction between the acoustic waves, fiber filters, and particles. This setup focuses on generating aerosols that mimic real-world particle size distributions. The particle-laden air stream enters a bench-scale duct where the acoustic filtration device is mounted. Finally, the number concentration of particles upstream and downstream of the acoustic filtration device is measured to evaluate the capture efficiency of the system.\nSupervisor:\nDavid E M Warsinger\nMentor:\nDavid E M Warsinger\nType of work required:\nBuilding apparatuses, running experiments, analyzing data, creating publication graphics, writing, graphic design, journal publications and patents\nWebsites:\nhttps://www.warsinger.com/\nQualifications:\nThe student who joins this lab will be expected to attend weekly lab meetings and sub-group meetings.
