We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe",

The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe",

Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe",

The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.

We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task.
