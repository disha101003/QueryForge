Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

From 1995 to 2003, he worked in the Silicon ULSI group at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ. Since returning to Purdue in 2004, his group has explored the reliability physics of nanotransistors, limits of nanobiosensors, atom-to-farm modeling of solar cells, and physics/technology of Landau transistors. He is a fellow of IEEE, APS, and AAAS. His awards include the 2006 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Medal for contributions to device technology for communication systems, the 2015 SRC Technical Excellence Award for fundamental contributions to reliability physics, and the 2018 IEEE EDS Education Award.  Prof. Alam enjoys teaching: More than 350,000 students worldwide have learned some aspects of semiconductor devices from his web-enabled courses. \n\nALAM CEED group\nOur group focuses on end-to-end modeling and characterization of electronic, optoelectronic, and bio-electronic devices, with an emphasis on their reliability physics. We look for system-level technological bottlenecks as new research topics and identify those problems whose solutions will illuminate the deeper physical principles involved. Our goal is the define  the \"performance and reliability\" potential of the technology for particular system-level applications.\n\nIn the past, we have worked on performance limits of resonant tunneling diodes and semiconductor lasers, theory of selective-area MOCVD crystal growth for optoelectronic ICs, mechanics of ALD crystal growth high-k dielectric deposition, and scaling limits of gate oxides and physics of oxide-semiconductor interface for MOSFET applications. For all these problems, we have developed new theoretical and computation tools to analyze the problems, worked closely with experimentalists to cross-check and verify our model predictions, and eventually encapsulated our understanding in broadly available tools for engineering",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

Prior to joining Purdue, I was a Research Associate (2019-2022) at Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory (hosted by Prof. Robert J. Wood), and a Postdoctoral Fellow (2018-2019) at Harvard Agile Robotics (supervised by Prof. Scott Kuindersma) at Harvard University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology (2018), where I worked with Prof. Erik I. Verriest and Prof. Patricio A. Vela.  I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

            "text": "and Continual Learning\nIn this direction, we study complex planning and learning based on partial and evolving knowledge in real time. We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

From 1995 to 2003, he worked in the Silicon ULSI group at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ. Since returning to Purdue in 2004, his group has explored the reliability physics of nanotransistors, limits of nanobiosensors, atom-to-farm modeling of solar cells, and physics/technology of Landau transistors. He is a fellow of IEEE, APS, and AAAS. His awards include the 2006 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Medal for contributions to device technology for communication systems, the 2015 SRC Technical Excellence Award for fundamental contributions to reliability physics, and the 2018 IEEE EDS Education Award.  Prof. Alam enjoys teaching: More than 350,000 students worldwide have learned some aspects of semiconductor devices from his web-enabled courses. \n\nALAM CEED group\nOur group focuses on end-to-end modeling and characterization of electronic, optoelectronic, and bio-electronic devices, with an emphasis on their reliability physics. We look for system-level technological bottlenecks as new research topics and identify those problems whose solutions will illuminate the deeper physical principles involved. Our goal is the define  the \"performance and reliability\" potential of the technology for particular system-level applications.\n\nIn the past, we have worked on performance limits of resonant tunneling diodes and semiconductor lasers, theory of selective-area MOCVD crystal growth for optoelectronic ICs, mechanics of ALD crystal growth high-k dielectric deposition, and scaling limits of gate oxides and physics of oxide-semiconductor interface for MOSFET applications. For all these problems, we have developed new theoretical and computation tools to analyze the problems, worked closely with experimentalists to cross-check and verify our model predictions, and eventually encapsulated our understanding in broadly available tools for engineering",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

I previously served as a research associate in the Institute for Systems Research at the University of Maryland, College Park, a consultant at the United Technologies Research Center, and as the Associate Chair and the Director for Graduate Studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Notre Dame.\n\nMy current research interests are in the broad area of distributed decision making, using both data-driven and model-driven approaches, with applications to the emerging smart and integrated architecture of societal infrastructure such as transportation networks, power grid, and water distribution networks. Topics of interest include developing learning approaches suitable for control, compositional control for large scale systems, cyber-physical security and privacy, and incentive design in distributed estimation and control. \n\nCV: https://engineering.purdue.edu/Vijay-Gupta/cv.pdf\n\n\nContact Info\n\nVijay Gupta\nProfessor of Electrical and Computer Engineering\ngupta869 at purdue dot edu\nAddress\nPurdue University\nElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nElectrical Engineering Building\n465 Northwestern Ave.\nWest Lafayette, Indiana 47907-2035\n\n \n",

Prior to joining Purdue, I was a Research Associate (2019-2022) at Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory (hosted by Prof. Robert J. Wood), and a Postdoctoral Fellow (2018-2019) at Harvard Agile Robotics (supervised by Prof. Scott Kuindersma) at Harvard University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology (2018), where I worked with Prof. Erik I. Verriest and Prof. Patricio A. Vela.  I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

            "text": "and Continual Learning\nIn this direction, we study complex planning and learning based on partial and evolving knowledge in real time. We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

From 1995 to 2003, he worked in the Silicon ULSI group at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ. Since returning to Purdue in 2004, his group has explored the reliability physics of nanotransistors, limits of nanobiosensors, atom-to-farm modeling of solar cells, and physics/technology of Landau transistors. He is a fellow of IEEE, APS, and AAAS. His awards include the 2006 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Medal for contributions to device technology for communication systems, the 2015 SRC Technical Excellence Award for fundamental contributions to reliability physics, and the 2018 IEEE EDS Education Award.  Prof. Alam enjoys teaching: More than 350,000 students worldwide have learned some aspects of semiconductor devices from his web-enabled courses. \n\nALAM CEED group\nOur group focuses on end-to-end modeling and characterization of electronic, optoelectronic, and bio-electronic devices, with an emphasis on their reliability physics. We look for system-level technological bottlenecks as new research topics and identify those problems whose solutions will illuminate the deeper physical principles involved. Our goal is the define  the \"performance and reliability\" potential of the technology for particular system-level applications.\n\nIn the past, we have worked on performance limits of resonant tunneling diodes and semiconductor lasers, theory of selective-area MOCVD crystal growth for optoelectronic ICs, mechanics of ALD crystal growth high-k dielectric deposition, and scaling limits of gate oxides and physics of oxide-semiconductor interface for MOSFET applications. For all these problems, we have developed new theoretical and computation tools to analyze the problems, worked closely with experimentalists to cross-check and verify our model predictions, and eventually encapsulated our understanding in broadly available tools for engineering",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

I previously served as a research associate in the Institute for Systems Research at the University of Maryland, College Park, a consultant at the United Technologies Research Center, and as the Associate Chair and the Director for Graduate Studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Notre Dame.\n\nMy current research interests are in the broad area of distributed decision making, using both data-driven and model-driven approaches, with applications to the emerging smart and integrated architecture of societal infrastructure such as transportation networks, power grid, and water distribution networks. Topics of interest include developing learning approaches suitable for control, compositional control for large scale systems, cyber-physical security and privacy, and incentive design in distributed estimation and control. \n\nCV: https://engineering.purdue.edu/Vijay-Gupta/cv.pdf\n\n\nContact Info\n\nVijay Gupta\nProfessor of Electrical and Computer Engineering\ngupta869 at purdue dot edu\nAddress\nPurdue University\nElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nElectrical Engineering Building\n465 Northwestern Ave.\nWest Lafayette, Indiana 47907-2035\n\n \n",

Prior to joining Purdue, I was a Research Associate (2019-2022) at Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory (hosted by Prof. Robert J. Wood), and a Postdoctoral Fellow (2018-2019) at Harvard Agile Robotics (supervised by Prof. Scott Kuindersma) at Harvard University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology (2018), where I worked with Prof. Erik I. Verriest and Prof. Patricio A. Vela.  I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

            "text": "and Continual Learning\nIn this direction, we study complex planning and learning based on partial and evolving knowledge in real time. We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

From 1995 to 2003, he worked in the Silicon ULSI group at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ. Since returning to Purdue in 2004, his group has explored the reliability physics of nanotransistors, limits of nanobiosensors, atom-to-farm modeling of solar cells, and physics/technology of Landau transistors. He is a fellow of IEEE, APS, and AAAS. His awards include the 2006 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Medal for contributions to device technology for communication systems, the 2015 SRC Technical Excellence Award for fundamental contributions to reliability physics, and the 2018 IEEE EDS Education Award.  Prof. Alam enjoys teaching: More than 350,000 students worldwide have learned some aspects of semiconductor devices from his web-enabled courses. \n\nALAM CEED group\nOur group focuses on end-to-end modeling and characterization of electronic, optoelectronic, and bio-electronic devices, with an emphasis on their reliability physics. We look for system-level technological bottlenecks as new research topics and identify those problems whose solutions will illuminate the deeper physical principles involved. Our goal is the define  the \"performance and reliability\" potential of the technology for particular system-level applications.\n\nIn the past, we have worked on performance limits of resonant tunneling diodes and semiconductor lasers, theory of selective-area MOCVD crystal growth for optoelectronic ICs, mechanics of ALD crystal growth high-k dielectric deposition, and scaling limits of gate oxides and physics of oxide-semiconductor interface for MOSFET applications. For all these problems, we have developed new theoretical and computation tools to analyze the problems, worked closely with experimentalists to cross-check and verify our model predictions, and eventually encapsulated our understanding in broadly available tools for engineering",

I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics.

Working at the intersection of learning and control, our group develops new models, algorithms, and theories that make autonomous agents capable of safe, efficient, and human-aware decision-making under uncertainty, with continual adaptation to new environments and tasks. The research problems we are interested in broadly relate to reinforcement learning, active perception, knowledge representation, online learning, control theory, and multi-agent systems. Some applications of interest for the designed solutions are robotics, disaster response, sustainability, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. The three major directions we currently pursue, along with examples of our high-level methodological approach, are described below.\n\nActive Information-Gathering for Control\nIn this direction, we study active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data for control tasks. We formulate new classes of control-oriented information-gathering problems and analyze their computational and statistical complexity. We design task-oriented information utility metrics to quantify the importance of different information sources or parts of data given partial, uncertain knowledge about the environment and the task. We also develop efficient algorithms, accompanied by theoretical performance guarantees, to optimize for information utility given the resource constraints.\n\nCompositional",

We design online learning algorithms with theoretical regret analyses for adaptive decision-making in a variety of settings, including structured bandits and reinforcement learning. We develop principled ways of incorporating structured side knowledge, such as automata-based task representations, probabilistic graphical models, causal models, and game-theoretic structures, to accelerate and improve sequential decision-making. In settings where such structures exist but are unknown a priori, we explore joint learning of these structured knowledge and optimal decision-making strategies.\n\nHuman-Aware Learning and Control\nIn this direction, we study autonomous decision-making, for instance, for robots and more generally, AI systems, when interacting and collaborating with humans through different modalities. We design learning algorithms that utilize cognitive models to enable the autonomous agent to form a probabilistic understanding of human intent and preferences. We develop adaptive and safe decision-making strategies capable of incorporating the evolving knowledge based on human feedback. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability and the explainability of the decisions in these human-AI interactive settings and analyze the potential trade-offs between these factors and the performance.\n\nTeaching:\nPurdue University\nECE 59500: Reinforcement Learning - Theory and Algorithms, Fall 2023 & Fall 2024.\nECE 49595: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2024.\nECE 20875: Python for Data Science, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, & Spring 2023\n\nContact:\n\nmahsa@purdue.edu\n(765) 494-3553\nPurdue Material Sciences and Electrical Engineering Building, Room 238, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States",

I previously served as a research associate in the Institute for Systems Research at the University of Maryland, College Park, a consultant at the United Technologies Research Center, and as the Associate Chair and the Director for Graduate Studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Notre Dame.\n\nMy current research interests are in the broad area of distributed decision making, using both data-driven and model-driven approaches, with applications to the emerging smart and integrated architecture of societal infrastructure such as transportation networks, power grid, and water distribution networks. Topics of interest include developing learning approaches suitable for control, compositional control for large scale systems, cyber-physical security and privacy, and incentive design in distributed estimation and control. \n\nCV: https://engineering.purdue.edu/Vijay-Gupta/cv.pdf\n\n\nContact Info\n\nVijay Gupta\nProfessor of Electrical and Computer Engineering\ngupta869 at purdue dot edu\nAddress\nPurdue University\nElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nElectrical Engineering Building\n465 Northwestern Ave.\nWest Lafayette, Indiana 47907-2035\n\n \n",

Prior to joining Purdue, I was a Research Associate (2019-2022) at Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory (hosted by Prof. Robert J. Wood), and a Postdoctoral Fellow (2018-2019) at Harvard Agile Robotics (supervised by Prof. Scott Kuindersma) at Harvard University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology (2018), where I worked with Prof. Erik I. Verriest and Prof. Patricio A. Vela.  I obtained Master's Degrees in Mathematics (2013) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (2013) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMy research program explores the cyclic learning cycle between biology, mathematical system theory, and robotics with an emphasis on control theoretic aspects of bio-inspired robots with extreme behaviors. These include 1) flapping-wing vehicles (e.g., Harvard RoboBee); and 2) impulsive systems inspired by mantis shrimp strikes (e.g., strikes within 4 ms). The intrinsic challenges for such systems with extreme behaviors include complex dynamics with multiple timescales (fast and slow) requiring high-speed sensing for feedback control design. In addition, due to their small size and weight, an understanding of environmental conditions (i.e., fluid conditions) is necessary for controlled motion in unstructured (e.g., outdoor) environments, where current insect-scale robot experiments are limited to indoor environments. \n\nMy goal is to design a robust control framework for such systems with extreme behaviors to overcome the challenges for control in unstructured environments, with a long-term goal of extending these methods toward intelligent swarm robotics. Constructing a novel control framework for these systems will provide a fundamental understanding of high mobility in synthetic systems and provide",
