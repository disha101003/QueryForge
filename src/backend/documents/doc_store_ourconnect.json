We will analyze and disseminate nonbinary engineering graduate student interviews regarding their mentoring relationships to answer the question: How do nonbinary STEM students access support from cisgender allies and their queer, transgender, and nonbinary peers?\nSupervisor:\nKerrie A Douglas\nMentor\nColeman Blaine Thompson\nType of work required:\nThe student researcher has an opportunity to support the STEM nonbinary community through research around nonbinary mentoring relationships. The student researcher will work with two nonbinary PhD students in engineering education to analyze interviews and write up findings for an engineering education conference or journal paper. Through their work, the student researchers will develop their professional skills, such as qualitative methods and research communication, and develop their identity as a queer engineer.\nQualifications:\nWhile this project is based in the School of Engineering Education, this project welcomes queer/trans/nonbinary students interested in research on nonbinary student mentoring relationships across the college of engineering, regardless of their engineering discipline.
