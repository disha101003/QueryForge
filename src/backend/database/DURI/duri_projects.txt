Opportunities and Risks of Biometric Security in the Age of Generative AI
Program:
DUIRI - Discovery Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Internship
Term:
Spring 2025
Status:
Accepted
Research Area:
Global Security
Description:
With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart sensing devices ranging from smart wearables, such as Fitbits or Apple watches, to smartphones are packed with a range of sensors helping us with a range of services from unlocking cars and homes to validating financial transactions, among several other services. But often, these services are delivered based on a user’s sensitive personal information, including demographic identity and various biometric data, ranging from heart rate to breathing patterns. Therefore, researchers have been using this biometric data to validate a user. However, in the age of Generative AI, it is possible to produce synthetic data. Hence, it is important to understand how biometric samples can be fatal in predicting a user’s identity and his/her entire cyber-physical space, which has been secured with those biometrics in order to foster global security.
Supervisor:

Mentor:
Sudip Vhaduri
Type of work required:
Working with an interdisciplinary research team, in this project, students will first process various types of data, e.g., heart rate, gait, and breathing patterns, among several others obtained from smartphones and smart wearables. Then, students will visualize and compute different features. Finally, students will develop machine learning and AI models to generate synthetic data that can be used to breach an authentication model developed with the user’s original data. During this project, student researchers will be closely guided in every step, including problem formulation, data processing and characterizations, statistical analysis, and data visualization, model development, and interpretation of findings. Participating in this project, our student researchers will achieve technical expertise to solve real-world problems. The students will also get a clear idea of how their scientific discovery contributes to the entire community in terms of securing their cyber-physical space.

Project:
Visualize Music using Generative Models of Artificial Intelligence
Program:
DUIRI - Discovery Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Internship
Term:
Spring 2025
Status:
Accepted
Research Area:
Artificial Intelligence, Generative Models, Music, Hear Impaired
Description:
This project belongs to the strategic area of global health. Playing and listening to music is one of the most universal forms of communication and entertainment across cultures. Unfortunately, many people are hearing-impaired, unable to fully enjoy music. By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to have some degree of hearing loss, and at least 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation (source: World Health Organization). This project aims to create technologies that visualize music, assisting the hearing-impaired in understanding and enjoying music. The technical process comprises the following steps: (a) Music is analyzed and classified into multiple dimensions, including instrumentation, emotion, tempo, pitch range, harmony, dynamics, and more. This analysis yields textual descriptions. (b) The texts form features and are inputs to machine learning models for classification. (c) These models predict the genre of the input audio and its associated emotions. These predictions form the basis for text prompts that describe the music. (d) The prompts are fed into generative machine models (e.g., DALL-E-2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney) to create visual representations, such as images or videos. (e) The visual representations are continuously updated as the music plays, ensuring that the visual effects aptly mirror the musical changes. Variations in the prompts produce different styles of images. These images and videos are generated without human intervention, significantly reducing costs and time to produce visual representations tailored to the specific piece of music. This approach is different from video recordings of music performance because recordings can provide only passive watching experience. In contrast, the proposed solution has the advantage of creating personalized and interactive entertainment experience for the hearing-impaired. This proposed project will conduct extensive user studies to evaluate whether generative models can effectively produce visual representations of music's rich expression, heralding a novel form of entertainment for the hearing-impaired.

Project:
ISF: Acoustic bioaerosol removal in HVAC systems
Program:
DUIRI - Discovery Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Internship
Term:
Spring 2025
Status:
Accepted
Research Area:
HVAC, Acoustics, Fluid mechanics, and aerosol transport.
Description:
Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 and various gaseous pollutants in the surrounding air pose a significant threat to humanity. The quality of indoor air depends on the air quality of outdoor sources, and given the increased amount of time spent indoors by humans, research on air quality needs more focus than ever. Current state-of-the-art filtration technologies have severe limitations in capturing specific particle sizes called the most penetrating particle sizes (MPPS). This project explores a novel air purification technology that uses acoustic waves to enhance the capture efficiency of fiber filters. We investigate the potential of acoustic interaction and streaming forces to manipulate the movement of aerosols within a flowing stream to direct them toward the filter fibers. These systems require high-efficiency filters to remove MPPS, which further causes a high-pressure drop in the system.In this work, we try to harness the potential of acoustic radiation and streaming forces to improve the capture efficiency of the fiber filters. Our numerical simulations showed an increase of up to 12x -123x for different configurations of fiber filters. Currently, we are constructing a bench-scale experimental setup to demonstrate the complex interaction between the acoustic waves, fiber filters, and particles. This setup focuses on generating aerosols that mimic real-world particle size distributions. The particle-laden air stream enters a bench-scale duct where the acoustic filtration device is mounted. Finally, the number concentration of particles upstream and downstream of the acoustic filtration device is measured to evaluate the capture efficiency of the system.

Description:
Water pollution is a significant concern in many countries and requires innovative technologies to tackle them. Many pollutants hazardous to human health, including pesticides, fluoropolymers, and pathogens, can be broken down into their constituent minerals through photocatalysis. However, existing membranes need substantially improved UV light utilization and penetration for real-world use. We are working on consistently-sized nanostructures near the wavelengths of UV light to control light and enhance the performance of novel photocatalytic membranes. Furthermore, our group works on separation technologies to remove Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

Description:
Reverse osmosis is the most efficient method of purifying and recycling contaminated water. However, reverse osmosis is a process that requires high pressure systems, and somewhat involved flushing cycles of the membranes used to separate clean water from brackish water. There is a need for a streamlined process for the filtration of water, so the process is more continuous and efficient. This project is focused on the design, prototyping and testing of a Pulse Flow Reverse Osmosis test bench for the application of recirculating water in a home style prototype. The system will be tested by examining a variety of properties such as water pressure, temperature, flow, water chemistry. The goals of this project are centered around studying the feasibility of implementation of a novel and efficient reverse osmosis system for water purification and recycling to be used in indoor home and portable systems.
